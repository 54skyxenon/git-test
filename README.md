# git-test
### Collective repository for any kind of Git tutorial or workshop.

	<li> Code 4 Community Dev. Workshop </li>
</ul>

### The following material is the workshop handout verbatim.

## Repository (Repo)
A repository is the central location where the project is being kept and where changes will be tracked. Usually this will be a directory with many files in it.

## Branch
A branch is an independent line of work. Each branch records how you wrote the code to get to a certain point in your project.

## Staging
Staging is where you decide which files you want to keep track of.

## Commit
Making a commit is the same as taking a snapshot of your project at a certain point in time. When committing you will only keep track of the changes to files in staging.

## Checkout
Change which commit we are currently working on. This is really just moving our head tag!

## Merge
Merging is when you combine two separate branches back into one. There are two types of merges, <b>fast-forward merges</b> and <b>three-way merges</b>

## Fast-forward Merge
This is essentially moving one branch tag up to the same point as another branch tag.

## Three-way Merge
When two branches have diverged and both have commits that the other branch does not have you must do a 3-way merge.

## Rebase
Rebasing can be thought of as changing where a commit points to. Instead of commit D pointing to commit A, change it so commit D now points to commit C.

## Remote Branches
A remote branch is a branch that is being stored somewhere that is not on your local computer. If you're working on a project that's on GitHub then all the branches that are on GitHub's server are called remote branches while everything on your computer is a local branch.
